To run the Nike Website Project smoothly, keep things simple and organized. As the leader, have regular checkins with the team to discuss progress and solve any problems. Make sure everyone knows what they're responsible for and when things need to be done. Be flexible and ready to adjust plans if needed. With clear communication and a straightforward approach, we can build a great Nike website together.
