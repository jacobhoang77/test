<!-- History Paragraph -->
<div class="container mt-5">
    <h1 class="text-center">Nike History</h1>
    <p>In the early 1960s, in the heart of Oregon, two visionaries embarked on a journey that would revolutionize the world of athletic footwear and apparel. Bill Bowerman, a track and field coach at the University of Oregon, and Phil Knight, a middle-distance runner on Bowerman's team, joined forces to create what would eventually become the iconic brand known as Nike.</p>
    <p>Their journey began with a humble handshake agreement in 1964, with Knight pledging to distribute Japanese running shoes made by Onitsuka Tiger (now ASICS) in the United States. Operating under the name Blue Ribbon Sports, Knight and Bowerman started selling shoes out of the trunk of Knight's car, traveling to track meets and building relationships with athletes.
        As their business grew, Knight and Bowerman recognized the potential to design and manufacture their own athletic footwear. In 1971, they officially launched their own line of shoes under the brand name Nike, named after the Greek goddess of victory.</p>
    <p>The birth of Nike was marked by innovation and boldness. Bowerman, renowned for his expertise in coaching and shoe design, experimented with various materials and construction techniques to create lighter, more durable shoes that could enhance athletes' performance. Meanwhile, Knight, armed with his business acumen and determination, spearheaded the company's expansion and marketing efforts.
        One of Nike's defining moments came in 1972 at the Olympic Trials, where American marathoner Steve Prefontaine donned Nike shoes and captured the attention of the world with his remarkable performance. The sight of Prefontaine wearing Nike shoes propelled the brand into the spotlight and solidified its reputation for quality and performance.</p>
    <p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Nike continued to push boundaries, introducing groundbreaking innovations such as the Waffle Trainer, Air cushioning technology, and the iconic "Just Do It" slogan, which would become synonymous with the brand's ethos of determination and perseverance.
        With each passing year, Nike's influence grew exponentially, transcending the realm of athletics to become a cultural phenomenon. From sponsoring legendary athletes like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods to collaborating with artists and designers on limited-edition releases, Nike became more than just a sportswear company it became a lifestyle brand that resonated with people around the world.</p>
    <p>Today, Nike stands as a global powerhouse, with its iconic Swoosh logo symbolizing excellence, innovation, and the relentless pursuit of greatness. From its humble beginnings in Oregon to its status as one of the most recognizable brands on the planet, Nike's journey is a testament to the power of vision, passion, and the unwavering belief in the ability to "Just Do It."</p>
